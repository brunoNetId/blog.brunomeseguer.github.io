Thanks for visiting my blog.

To introduce myself, I started working with distributed systems precisely in the year 2000 with the change of millennia (was that a sign? am I the one? I might have seen too many movies!). Back then, I was already playing/applying messaging and using sophisticated (at the time) integration tools.

Over the years I've worked in various industries, including the telco space where I stayed for over 10 very busy years at Vofafone Global, building integration platforms.

Now I'm working as a solution architect at Red Hat, specialised in our messaging and integration products. This blog will allow me to share my professional experience with others and hopefully you'll find the articles useful in some way or another.
